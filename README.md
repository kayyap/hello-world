I have heard of Git but never knew what it was until now. I'm hoping to learn a lot about the lastest web development tools and languages in 2017. By the end of 2017 I would like to use this knowledge to get a job in web development that provides me with a better work life balance and much better compensation and benefits than I currently experience.
